As he came into the window.
Was a sound of a crescendo.
He came into her apartment.
He left the bloodstains on the carpet.
She ran underneath the table.
He could see she was unable.
So she ran into the bedroom.
She was struck down.
It was her doom.
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sound at the window.
Then he struck you, a crescendo, Annie.
He came into your apartment.
Left the bloodstains on the carpet.
And then you ran into the bedroom.
You were struck down.
It was your doom.
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?

So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by.
You've been hit by.
A Smooth Criminal.
So they came in to the outway.
It was Sunday, what a black day.
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations.
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay? (Annie, are you okay?)

He came into your apartment.
Left the bloodstains on the carpet.
And then you ran into the bedroom.
You were struck down.

(Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!)
Annie are you okay? (I don't know).
